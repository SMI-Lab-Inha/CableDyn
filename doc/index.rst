CableDyn
========

**CableDyn** is an open-source (`Apache-2.0 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_)
cable and mooring dynamics solver for floating offshore wind turbines and substations, written
in modern **Fortran 2018**. It targets dynamic power cables in the lazy-wave configuration and
taut, semi-taut, and catenary moorings. It reads MoorDyn v2 input decks and has been compared
with MoorDyn-C, MoorDyn-F, and OrcaFlex on common reference cases.

.. admonition:: Release status
   :class: note

   CableDyn ``v0.1.0`` is the current stable release and the first public release.
   Every comparative-accuracy statement is linked to a passing benchmark in :doc:`validation`.
   The project remains below ``1.0.0``, so public APIs may evolve between minor releases.

Two solver paths
----------------

CableDyn is built on **two position-based finite-element formulations**, with no rotation
degrees of freedom in the line elements:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 74

   * - Path
     - Used for
   * - ``EI = 0`` **cable path**
     - chains and moorings — a positions-only element, a banded Newton/Armijo static solve
       seeded from an analytical catenary, and generalised-α dynamics with Morison and seabed
       loads.
   * - **cubic-Hermite bending path**
     - lazy-wave dynamic power cables — a position + material-tangent element carrying the exact
       nonlinear centreline curvature, with a Newton static solve seeded from the exact catenary
       and continued in ``EI``, and generalised-α dynamics.

Which path a line section uses is decided by its line type's bending stiffness ``EI``. A mixed
deck — chain moorings *and* a finite-EI power cable — is normal. Time integration is the
implicit Chung & Hulbert (1993) generalised-α scheme. The solver core is caller-agnostic behind
a single coupling boundary, with a thin shell per target: an **OpenFAST v5 module**
(``CompMooring = 5``; OpenFAST is maintained by NLR, the National Laboratory of the Rockies,
formerly NREL) and a standalone **C binding** couplable to CFD.

Download to first result in five minutes
----------------------------------------

#. Download ``CableDyn_driver.exe``, ``SHA256SUMS.txt``, and **Source code (zip)** (for the
   ``examples`` folder) from the `v0.1.0 release
   <https://github.com/SMI-Lab-Inha/CableDyn/releases/tag/v0.1.0>`_ and verify the checksum —
   :doc:`installation`. No installer and no runtime DLLs.
#. Put ``CableDyn_driver.exe`` in a working folder, unzip the source archive, and copy its
   ``examples`` folder next to the executable.
#. Create the output folder (the driver does not create it) and solve a mooring line:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force results | Out-Null
      .\CableDyn_driver.exe .\examples\chain_catenary_shallow_30m.dat .\results\shallow30

#. Read ``results\shallow30.out`` (fairlead tension 149.5 kN) and the along-line profile
   ``shallow30.static.out`` — :doc:`quickstart`.

Learning path
-------------

:doc:`quickstart` → :doc:`tutorials`: grounded catenary → spread mooring → lazy-wave cable →
prescribed motion → waves and current → synthetic ropes → buoys and rods → Python studies →
coupled floating turbine in OpenFAST. :doc:`examples` catalogues every shipped deck.

Reference and theory
--------------------

* Input: :doc:`driver_format` (the deck), :doc:`options`, :doc:`file_formats`; results:
  :doc:`outputs`; command line: :doc:`cli`; units, signs, and angles: :doc:`conventions`.
* Porting a MoorDyn or OrcaFlex model: :doc:`migrating`. Something failed:
  :doc:`troubleshooting` maps every message to its fix; see also :doc:`faq`.
* The equations and solvers: :doc:`theory` and :doc:`solver_paths`.

Validation
----------

Static and dynamic results are compared with analytical solutions, OrcaFlex, MoorDyn-C, and
MoorDyn-F on reference structures — the IEA-15MW VolturnUS-S moorings and the Lozon et al.
(2025) lazy-wave power cables at 80, 200, and 800 m water depth. Every comparison, tolerance,
and reproduction command is in :doc:`validation`.

CableDyn builds on the work of others, and we are grateful to the developers and maintainers
of MoorDyn (Hall et al.), whose open input format CableDyn reads and which serves as a
comparison reference; of OpenFAST, maintained by NLR (National Laboratory of the Rockies,
formerly NREL), which hosts CableDyn as a mooring module; and of OrcaFlex (Orcina Ltd.),
