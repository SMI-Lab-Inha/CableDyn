Examples
========

The ``examples/`` folder ships ready-to-run input decks. It is part of the source archive —
download **Source code (zip)** from the release page (:doc:`installation`); the executables do not
contain it. Every standalone deck below was run with ``CableDyn_driver.exe`` for this release;
the run time is the wall time on an ordinary desktop.

.. code-block:: powershell

   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force results | Out-Null   # the driver does not create it
   .\CableDyn_driver.exe .\examples\<deck>.dat .\results\<root>

Use the closest deck as a template, copy it under a new name, and keep every file it references
(motion, Syrope, bathymetry) in the same relative location. The deck grammar is in
:doc:`driver_format`, every option in :doc:`options`, and every output in :doc:`outputs`.

**Route** is the solver path the deck exercises: *cable* (``EI = 0`` element), *Hermite*
(finite-EI bending element), *points/bodies* (``EI = 0`` lines coupled to dynamic points, bodies,
or rods), or *mixed* (both elements in one deck). **Static** decks stop at the equilibrium;
**dynamic** decks march in time from it; **modal** decks compute natural periods and mode shapes
about it.

Line failure (accidental limit state)
-------------------------------------

A ``FAILURE`` row detaches a line from its fairlead mid-run, by time or by tension; the
examples ``README.md`` reports the transient on the remaining lines.

Dynamic power cables

The Lozon et al. (2025) installed lazy-wave cables at three reference sites. CableDyn finds each
touchdown and lazy-wave shape from the geometry alone; there is no initial-shape input.

       3.54 kN·m and ``Twist1`` 690°: the cable takes up 30° of the 720° by writhing out of its
       plane (``L1N58py``, 3.3 m). The range graph carries the torque and twist envelopes. See

The first three set ``TMax = 0`` (static only). The motion file holds absolute position,

OpenFAST coupling
-----------------

These files run CableDyn inside OpenFAST, maintained by NLR (National Laboratory of the Rockies,
formerly NREL).

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 44 56

   * - File
     - What it is
   * - ``openfast/IEA-15-UMaine_CompMooring5_CableDyn.fst``
     - IEA-15MW VolturnUS-S template with ``CompMooring = 5`` — :doc:`tutorial_openfast`
   * - ``openfast/CableDyn_UMaine.dat``
     - its CableDyn ``MooringFile``: three R4 chains, ``dtM = DT``
   * - ``openfast/IEA-15-UMaine_CompMooring3_MoorDyn.fst``
     - the same model with stock MoorDyn (``CompMooring = 3``)
   * - ``openfast/MoorDyn_UMaine.dat``
     - its stock MoorDyn v2 deck (also readable by CableDyn, see :doc:`migrating`)
   * - ``openfast/CableDyn_UMaine_rod.dat``, ``openfast/MoorDyn_UMaine_rod.dat``
     - lines 1 and 2 hung from the ends of a ``Coupled`` 100 m pontoon rod between their
       fairleads, with its stock MoorDyn twin (the coupled-rod comparison)
   * - ``openfast/IEA-15-UMaine_CompMooring5_CableDyn_LineFailure.fst``,
       ``openfast/CableDyn_UMaine_line_failure.dat``
     - the ``CompMooring = 5`` model with a ``FAILURE`` row: line 1 breaks at its fairlead at
       t = 100 s of a 400 s run (accidental limit state)
   * - ``openfast/README.md``
     - file roles and where to obtain the turbine sub-models
   * - ``iea15mw_umaine_mixed_cabledyn.dat``
     - three chains plus a finite-EI lazy-wave power cable with a grounded tail (mixed route).
       As a ``MooringFile`` it runs coupled; with ``CableDyn_driver.exe`` it writes the held-end
       statics (``TMax = 0``, < 1 s) or marches the held system when ``TMax > 0``
   * - ``iea15mw_umaine_openfast_cabledyn.dat``
     - an OpenFAST-only ``MooringFile`` for the same platform. Its fairleads are caller-driven
       and its water depth is host-owned, so ``CableDyn_driver.exe`` solves it with held
       fairleads and no seabed, which is not the moored configuration, and warns that the
       lines hang below their anchors; use ``spread_3line_chain.dat`` for the standalone
       equivalent

The turbine model itself (ElastoDyn, SeaState, HydroDyn, WAMIT data) comes from OpenFAST's
``r-test``; :doc:`tutorial_openfast` gives the exact steps.

Auxiliary data
--------------

These files are inputs referenced by decks, not decks:

* ``data/syrope/syrope_settings.dat`` — Syrope settings (names the OWC table, curve type, and
  shape parameters); ``data/syrope/syrope_owc.dat`` — the original working-curve table. Paths are
  relative to the referring file; copy all three Syrope files together.
* ``data/lozon/gomex80_heave_3m_12s_dt005.txt`` — the prescribed hang-off motion;
  ``data/lozon/generate_gomex80_heave.py`` — the script that writes it.
* ``data/vessel/vessel_surge_heave_pitch_12s_dt005.txt`` — the 6-DOF vessel record of
  ``lazy_wave_vessel_motion.dat``; ``data/vessel/generate_vessel_motion.py`` writes it;
  ``data/vessel/sample_rao.txt`` — the illustrative RAO table of ``lazy_wave_vessel_rao.dat``.
* ``data/range_tdp/chain_surge_5m_30s_dt005.txt`` — the fairlead surge of ``chain_range_tdp.dat``;
  ``data/range_tdp/generate_chain_surge.py`` writes it.
* ``data/torsion/hangoff_roll_2turns_60s_dt01.txt`` — the held hang-off with its roll column of
  ``torsion_lazy_wave_hangoff_twist.dat``; ``data/torsion/generate_hangoff_roll.py`` writes it.
* ``moordynC_wavekin/wave_frequencies.txt`` and ``moordynC_wavekin/current_profile.txt`` — the
  MoorDyn-C kinematics files, read from the folder of the deck beside them.
* ``plot_range_envelope.py`` — plots the tension envelope of a range-graph file.
