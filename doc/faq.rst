Frequently asked questions
==========================

Answers to recurring questions about CableDyn settings and results. For a rejected deck, a
non-zero exit code, or a named error message, see :doc:`troubleshooting`.

Modelling and inputs
--------------------

.. admonition:: Do I need a water depth?
   :class: note

   No. ``WtrDpth`` is optional — omit it for a suspended or taut line with no bottom contact.
   Supply it (or a ``bathymetryFile``) only when the line touches the seabed. Deck ``waves`` do
   require ``WtrDpth``.

.. admonition:: Do I have to rewrite a MoorDyn deck's LINES into SECTIONS?
   :class: note

   No. The stock 7-column MoorDyn row ``ID LineType AttachA AttachB UnstrLen NumSegs Outputs`` is
   accepted as a one-section line, and anchor-first lines are turned fairlead-first
   automatically. Use ``SECTIONS`` when one line object is built from several line types. See
   :doc:`driver_format`.

.. admonition:: Which solver path is my line on?
   :class: note

   It is decided per line by its sections' line-type ``EI``: a line whose sections all have
   ``EI = 0`` uses the cable path; a line with any ``EI > 0`` section uses the finite-EI
   cubic-Hermite path. A mixed deck can carry both kinds of line. See :doc:`concepts`.

.. admonition:: Can I set the solver tolerance?
   :class: note

   The dynamic Newton controls, yes: ``dynamic_solver rel abs max_iter backtracks [rhoInf]``
   sets the relative and absolute tolerances, the iteration budget, and the line-search
   backtracks (see :doc:`options` for which controls each route uses). The static-solver
   tolerances are built in, and keys like ``staticRelTol`` are rejected as unknown; this keeps
   every static initial condition reproducible.

Results
-------

.. admonition:: Why are my velocities and accelerations zero?
   :class: note

   ``L<L>N<J>v…`` / ``…a…`` channels are zero on a static-only run — there is no motion at the static
   IC. Add ``dtM``/``TMax`` (and, for a driven end, a ``motionFile``) to march dynamics.

.. admonition:: Why is ``AnchAngle`` about 90 degrees?
   :class: note

   ``FairAngle`` / ``AnchAngle`` are aliases of the **declinations** from +GZ (as OrcaFlex defines
   them), so a horizontal anchor segment is 90 degrees and a downward fairlead tangent exceeds 90
   degrees. Request ``FairIncl`` / ``AnchIncl`` for signed inclination below horizontal: zero is
   horizontal and positive is downward. ``FairDecl`` / ``AnchDecl`` provide explicitly named
   declinations.

.. admonition:: Why does static tension differ slightly from MoorDyn?
   :class: note

   CableDyn's static IC is a **Newton equilibrium**; MoorDyn reaches its
   initial state by drag-scaled dynamic relaxation. The two agree within the validated band
   (0.13–1.59 % on the validated chain cases); a small offset between the two approaches is
   expected. See :doc:`validation`.

.. admonition:: What should I do when the tensile monitor reports compression?
   :class: warning

   Treat the reported force, location, and time as an engineering validity check. ``warn`` allows a
   long run to finish and counts every accepted integration step outside the declared strain
   band; it does not make a compressive cable state physical. Small, localised excursions at a
   grounded tail may justify a documented tolerance study. Large or fatigue-region excursions require
   inspection of the motion convention, spatial and temporal convergence, contact state, and cable
   configuration before the response is used. Select ``True`` when any out-of-band compression must
   reject the step.

OpenFAST coupling
-----------------

.. admonition:: Why do CableDyn channels look stepped in an OpenFAST plot?
   :class: note

   CableDyn solves on ``dtM`` (0.1 s by default) and holds its committed loads/channels between
   solves on the faster glue clock of OpenFAST (maintained by NLR, the National Laboratory of the
   Rockies, formerly NREL). A smaller ``DT_Out`` records more copies of the held
   value; it does not add physical bandwidth. Plot ``<OpenFASTRoot>.CD.out`` for the solver-native
   record containing one row per genuine CableDyn solve. Set deck ``dtM = DT`` only when glue-rate
   solves are required, and demonstrate damage/range convergence by reducing ``dtM``.

.. admonition:: Why did ``dtM = 0.025 s`` make my coupled run much slower?
   :class: note

   Equal ``dtM`` and OpenFAST ``DT`` intentionally request a nonlinear CableDyn solve on every glue
   step, four times as many as the 0.1 s default. The release executables are serial; the
   threading advice in this answer applies only to source builds configured with OpenMP. On such
   builds an ``EI = 0`` line evaluates its elements in parallel only from 8192 elements and a
   finite-EI cable from 32 elements, while separate lines can still run concurrently; nested
   OpenMP teams are suppressed automatically. Keep the linear-algebra library to one thread when
   OpenMP parallelism is enabled (for example ``OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1``), then time the complete
   OpenFAST model. A fast isolated mooring
   benchmark does **not** imply a fast coupled run: OpenFAST may call ``CalcOutput`` several times
   per physical step with different trial kinematics. Set the environment variable
   ``CABLEDYN_PROFILE=1`` before running ``openfast.exe`` to separate CableDyn solve, SeaState
   sampling, output-probe, and native-I/O time. Keep ``ModCoupling`` fixed while
   comparing configurations. Do not switch to loose coupling merely to meet a wall-clock target; on
   the IEA-15MW reference model it materially changed platform and tension responses. Test
   ``OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`` as well as the intended threaded setting: three short lines can be too
   little work to amortise OpenMP overhead.

   Finally, require normal OpenFAST termination, and compare the ``Time Ratio`` that OpenFAST
   reports with the default solver settings (see :doc:`openfast`).

   A finite-bending interval that converges algebraically but exceeds the mesh-aware temporal
   increment check is retried internally with generalised-alpha substeps. A stalled tension-only
   standalone step uses the same bounded subdivision policy. Prescribed position, velocity, and
   acceleration remain one kinematically consistent C2 trajectory. The default recovery ceiling is
   1024 and ``recovery_max_substeps`` can adjust it without changing the committed host grid. A
   final failure reports the simulated interval, ceiling, and maximum prescribed displacement
   increment. The profiler reports the recovery count. Use a checkpoint (``ChkptTime`` in the
   ``.fst`` file) to replay any event without rerunning the full transient.
