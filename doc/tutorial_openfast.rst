Tutorial 9 — A floating wind turbine in OpenFAST
================================================

**Goal:** run the IEA-15MW reference turbine on the UMaine VolturnUS-S semi-submersible in the
release ``openfast.exe`` (OpenFAST, maintained by NLR, the National Laboratory of the Rockies,
formerly NREL) with CableDyn as its mooring module (``CompMooring = 5``), read the
CableDyn results, compare against stock MoorDyn in the same binary, and add a lazy-wave power
cable.

**Needs:** ``openfast.exe`` from the release, the ``examples`` folder, and Git (or a browser) to
fetch the turbine model · **Run time:** about 5 s for 70 s of simulation (the MoorDyn comparison run
takes a few minutes)

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

1. Fetch the turbine model
--------------------------

The CableDyn repository ships the mooring decks and ``.fst`` templates in
``examples/openfast/``, but not the turbine sub-models (ElastoDyn, SeaState, HydroDyn with its
WAMIT database, AeroDyn, InflowWind), which are maintained by the OpenFAST project. The templates
are wired to the IEA-15MW turbine-1 files of OpenFAST's regression-test case
``glue-codes/fast-farm/MD_Shared``. Use the revision the release was tested against,
``dd5feaaaa500ba7283140107806300d551cff0a7``.

With Git (downloads only that folder, about 7 MB):

.. code-block:: powershell

   Set-Location C:\CableDyn
   git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout https://github.com/OpenFAST/r-test.git
   Set-Location r-test
   git sparse-checkout set glue-codes/fast-farm/MD_Shared
   git checkout dd5feaaaa500ba7283140107806300d551cff0a7
   Set-Location ..

Without Git, download
``https://github.com/OpenFAST/r-test/archive/dd5feaaaa500ba7283140107806300d551cff0a7.zip``
(the whole regression suite, much larger) and extract only ``glue-codes/fast-farm/MD_Shared``
to ``C:\CableDyn\r-test\glue-codes\fast-farm\MD_Shared``.

2. Assemble the case folder
---------------------------

Copy the turbine model and the CableDyn/MoorDyn integration files (every ``.fst`` and ``.dat``
in ``examples\openfast``) into one folder:

.. code-block:: powershell

   $case = 'C:\CableDyn\iea15_case'
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $case | Out-Null
   Copy-Item -Recurse .\r-test\glue-codes\fast-farm\MD_Shared\* $case
   Copy-Item .\examples\openfast\*.fst, .\examples\openfast\*.dat $case
   Set-Location $case

The folder now holds, among others:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 46 54

   * - File
     - Role
   * - ``IEA-15-UMaine_CompMooring5_CableDyn.fst``
     - top-level OpenFAST input selecting CableDyn
   * - ``CableDyn_UMaine.dat``
     - the CableDyn ``MooringFile``: three 850 m R4 chains, 200 m water depth
   * - ``IEA-15-UMaine_CompMooring3_MoorDyn.fst`` / ``MoorDyn_UMaine.dat``
     - the identical model with stock MoorDyn, for the A/B
   * - ``IEA-15-240-RWT-UMaineSemi_ElastoDynT1.dat``, ``..._HydroDynT1.dat``, ``SeaState.dat``,
       ``HydroData\``, ``Airfoils\``, …
     - the turbine and platform model from ``MD_Shared``

3. Make the model a single turbine at the origin
------------------------------------------------

``MD_Shared`` is a two-turbine FAST.Farm case. Its turbine-1 files start the platform at its farm
pose (20.3 m surge, 180° yaw, small roll/pitch/heave) and set HydroDyn's reference yaw
``PtfmRefY`` to 180°. The CableDyn and MoorDyn templates place the fairleads in platform axes
and the anchors around the origin, so reset the platform to the origin:

.. code-block:: powershell

   $ed = 'IEA-15-240-RWT-UMaineSemi_ElastoDynT1.dat'
   (Get-Content $ed) -replace '^\s*\S+(\s+Ptfm(Surge|Sway|Heave|Roll|Pitch|Yaw)\s)', '          0$1' |
       Set-Content $ed -Encoding ascii
   $hd = 'IEA-15-240-RWT-UMaineSemi_HydroDynT1.dat'
   (Get-Content $hd) -replace '^\s*\S+(\s+PtfmRefY\s)', '             0$1' |
       Set-Content $hd -Encoding ascii

This sets ``PtfmSurge``, ``PtfmSway``, ``PtfmHeave``, ``PtfmRoll``, ``PtfmPitch``, ``PtfmYaw``
(ElastoDyn) and ``PtfmRefY`` (HydroDyn) to zero and changes nothing else.

.. warning::

   Skipping this step still runs to completion, but the yawed, offset platform stretches line 1
   far beyond its 850 m length: CableDyn and MoorDyn then both report a physically meaningless
   321 MN fairlead tension. Always read the initial fairlead tensions before trusting a coupled
   run.

4. How CableDyn is wired in
---------------------------

Two rows of the ``.fst`` select the module and its input:

.. code-block:: text

         5   CompMooring     - Compute mooring system (switch) {0=None; 1=MAP++; 2=FEAMooring; 3=MoorDyn; 4=OrcaFlex; 5=CableDyn}
   "CableDyn_UMaine.dat"  MooringFile     - Name of file containing mooring system input parameters (quoted string)

The rest of the template: ``TMax = 70 s``, glue step ``DT = 0.025 s``, ElastoDyn, SeaState, and
HydroDyn on; InflowWind, AeroDyn, and ServoDyn off (no wind, no controller DLL needed).
``SeaState.dat`` from ``MD_Shared`` specifies an irregular JONSWAP sea, ``Hs = 6 m``,
``Tp = 12 s``.

Division of responsibility:

* **OpenFAST owns** the clock (``TMax``, ``DT``), gravity, water density, water depth, the
  platform motion, and the wave/current field (SeaState). Their values in the CableDyn deck are
  overridden; ``motionFile`` and deck ``waves`` rows are rejected in a coupled deck, and a deck
  ``current`` row is kept only as a steady current on a single-turbine, pure ``EI = 0`` deck
  without Rigid6 bodies or rods in a SeaState without waves or current.
* **The CableDyn deck owns** line types, points, lines, sections, seabed contact, solver
  settings, its own time step ``dtM``, and the ``OUTPUTS`` list. Fairlead ``Coupled`` points are
  given in platform axes; ``Fixed`` anchors in global axes.
* **The time step.** ``CableDyn_UMaine.dat`` sets ``dtM = 0.025`` = ``DT``, so CableDyn solves
  every glue step. Without a deck ``dtM``, CableDyn targets 0.1 s rounded to a whole number of
  glue steps and holds its loads between solves. For fatigue, snap, or touchdown work use
  ``dtM = DT`` or prove that a coarser value converges.

The complete ownership table is in :doc:`options`; the coupling contract in :doc:`openfast`.

5. Run it
---------

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\CableDyn\openfast.exe .\IEA-15-UMaine_CompMooring5_CableDyn.fst

The CableDyn part of the console (other modules' lines trimmed):

    OpenFAST terminated normally.

Check, in order:

#. ``Running CableDyn (`` — the CableDyn-enabled executable is in use. A stock OpenFAST rejects
   ``CompMooring = 5`` during input validation.
#. The line inventory (3 lines, 6 points) and ``dtM``.
#. The initial fairlead tensions: 2.437 MN per line, with the line tangent 55.7° below
   horizontal, as in the standalone ``spread_3line_chain.dat`` of :doc:`tutorial_spread`. The
   tension is the magnitude of the line-end force, which includes the fairlead node's share of
   the chain weight, so the force points slightly steeper, 56.3° below horizontal, with a
   horizontal component of 1.351 MN.
#. The ``OUTPUTS`` at t = 0: ``FairTen1`` reads 2.436 MN, 0.04 % below the equilibrium value
   above. The equilibrium is solved before the SeaState kinematics act, and at t = 0 the wave
   kinematics add their hydrodynamic load on the fairlead end node. In still water
   (``WaveMod = 0``) the two values are equal. ``.CD.static.out`` holds the equilibrium, and the
   t = 0 row of ``.CD.out`` and of the main ``.out`` holds the t = 0 values.
#. ``OpenFAST terminated normally.``

:doc:`conventions`.

7. Compare with MoorDyn
-----------------------

The same binary still contains stock MoorDyn. The twin ``.fst`` differs only in
``CompMooring = 3`` and ``MooringFile = "MoorDyn_UMaine.dat"``. That deck sets the MoorDyn option
``SeaState WaterKin``, so MoorDyn's lines see the same SeaState waves that CableDyn samples at its
line nodes by default. Without that row MoorDyn lines see still water while CableDyn's see the
waves, and the fairlead tension standard deviations then differ by tens of percent for reasons
that have nothing to do with the solvers:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\CableDyn\openfast.exe .\IEA-15-UMaine_CompMooring3_MoorDyn.fst

Its console shows ``Running MoorDyn (v2.3.8, ...)``, ``Water kinematics will be simulated using
the SeaState method``, a dynamic-relaxation initialisation, and ``MoorDyn initialization
completed.``; MoorDyn writes ``...MD.out`` and puts its channels (upper-case ``FAIRTEN1`` …) in
the main ``.out``. Statistics over 10–70 s from the two main output files:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 28 18 18 18 18

   * - Channel
     - CableDyn mean
     - MoorDyn mean
     - CableDyn std
     - MoorDyn std
   * - ``PtfmSurge`` (m)
     - 0.893
     - 0.893
     - 1.364
     - 1.363
   * - ``PtfmHeave`` (m)
     - −1.030
     - −1.030
     - 1.216
     - 1.215
   * - ``PtfmPitch`` (deg)
     - 1.497
     - 1.497
     - 1.382
     - 1.381
   * - fairlead tension, line 1 (MN)
     - 2.452
     - 2.452
     - 0.136
     - 0.136
   * - fairlead tension, line 2 (MN)
     - 2.376
     - 2.376
     - 0.069
     - 0.069

The platform motions agree to within 0.2 %, the mean fairlead tensions to within 0.01 % and
their standard deviations to within 0.5 %. Both codes report the fairlead tension as the force
at the line end, which includes the end node's share of the chain weight. On this stiff chain
the MoorDyn deck uses a 0.2 ms explicit step and a dynamic-relaxation start and evaluates the
SeaState kinematics at every node of every substep, so allow a few minutes for that run.

To compare in still water instead, set ``WaveMod = 0`` in ``SeaState.dat`` for both runs. To keep
the waves on the platform but remove them from CableDyn's lines (for example against a MoorDyn
deck without ``WaterKin``), point the CableDyn deck's ``WaterKin`` row at a MoorDyn-style
WaterKin file with ``WaveKinMod 0`` and ``CurrentMod 0`` (:ref:`waterkin-file-modes`).

A 70 s run is a smoke test, not a comparison. For a real A/B, keep wind, waves, controller,
``DT``, output channels, and initial conditions identical, discard the start-up transient, run
at least one hour of analysis window, and compare statistics, spectra, and damage-equivalent
loads (:doc:`tutorial_python`). The published comparisons are in :doc:`validation`.

8. Add a lazy-wave power cable
------------------------------

``examples/iea15mw_umaine_mixed_cabledyn.dat`` adds a fourth, finite-EI line to the same three
chains: a dynamic power cable from a platform hang-off to a seabed termination, with a
bare/buoyant/bare section layout that forms a lazy wave and a grounded tail on the 200 m
seabed. Copy it into the case folder and point a copy of the ``.fst`` at it:

.. code-block:: powershell

   Copy-Item C:\CableDyn\examples\iea15mw_umaine_mixed_cabledyn.dat .
   (Get-Content .\IEA-15-UMaine_CompMooring5_CableDyn.fst) `
       -replace '"CableDyn_UMaine.dat"', '"iea15mw_umaine_mixed_cabledyn.dat"' |
       Set-Content .\Mixed_CableDyn.fst -Encoding ascii
   C:\CableDyn\openfast.exe .\Mixed_CableDyn.fst

.. code-block:: text

      Created CableDyn model: 4 line object(s), 8 point(s), 6 section(s) [EI=0: 3, finite-EI: 1].
      ...
      Line 4 fairlead effective tension: 11898 N
         force [Fx, Fy, Fz]: [1218.2, 0, -11835] N, inclination=84.123 deg
         line tangent: inclination=83.927 deg, declination=173.93 deg, azimuth=0 deg
      ...
         Curv4N20 = 9.15231E-02 (1/m)
         BendMom4N20 = 1821.3 (N.m)

CableDyn found the cable's touchdown and lazy-wave shape by itself: in
``Mixed_CableDyn.CD.static.out``, 38 of line 4's 88 nodes lie on the seabed. The chain moorings
use the cable element and the power cable the cubic-Hermite bending element, in one deck and one
coupled solve. Plot line 4's ``Curvature`` against ``ArcLength`` before looking at the time
history, and request ``Curv4N<J>``/``BendMom4N<J>`` channels at the hang-off, sag bend, arch, and
touchdown for fatigue.

Exercises
---------

1. **Wind.** Set ``CompInflow = 1`` and ``CompAero = 2`` in a copy of the ``.fst`` (the
   ``MD_Shared`` InflowWind and AeroDyn files are already present) and compare the mean surge and
   line-1 tension with the parked case.
2. **Supercycling.** Remove the ``dtM`` row from ``CableDyn_UMaine.dat``. The console now
   reports ``dtM = 0.1 s (4 x glue DT; the default )``, the run takes about 3 s instead of 5 s,
   and ``.CD.out`` has one row per 0.1 s. Here the line-1 tension statistics over 10–70 s barely
   move (mean 2.453 MN, std 0.136 MN, against 2.452 and 0.136 MN); verify that for your own
   quantities before adopting a coarser step.
3. **Still water.** Set ``WaveMod = 0`` in ``SeaState.dat``. Without waves the platform settles
   toward its still-water pose (mean heave −1.1 m, pitch 1.5°) with a decaying heave–pitch
   oscillation, and the line-1 tension stays within ±2 % of 2.41 MN.
