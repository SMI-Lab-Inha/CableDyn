Command-line reference
======================

CableDyn ships one native solver executable and four Python console tools:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 28 72

   * - Command
     - Purpose
   * - ``CableDyn_driver``
     - the standalone solver: reads a deck, solves the static initial condition and, when the
       deck asks for it, the dynamic march, and writes the result tables. Released as
       ``CableDyn_driver.exe``; a source build produces the same program as ``build/cabledyn``
       (``build\bin\cabledyn.exe`` with the conda toolchain on Windows)
   * - ``cabledyn-run``
     - runs one deck through the native solver and validates its main output
   * - ``cabledyn-post``
     - summaries, exports, plots, fatigue, spectra and coherence of result files
   * - ``cabledyn-deck``
     - validates, inspects, edits and generates decks
   * - ``cabledyn-study``
     - runs a generated parameter study

Coupled runs in OpenFAST, maintained by NLR (National Laboratory of the Rockies, formerly NREL),
need no separate executable: CableDyn is compiled into ``openfast.exe``
and selected with ``CompMooring = 5`` (see :doc:`openfast`). CFD and scripting hosts use the
shared library through the :doc:`C API <capi>` or the :doc:`Python package <python>`.

``CableDyn_driver`` — the standalone solver
-------------------------------------------

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

   CableDyn_driver <deck.dat> <out_root>
   CableDyn_driver -v | -V | -version | -VERSION | --version
   CableDyn_driver -h | -H | -help | -HELP | --help | -? | /?

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 18 82

   * - Argument
     - Meaning
   * - ``<deck.dat>``
     - the input deck (:doc:`driver_format`). Relative paths are resolved against the current
       working directory; files the deck references (``motionFile``, bathymetry, WaterKin,
       Syrope tables) are resolved against the **deck's** directory (:doc:`file_formats`).
   * - ``<out_root>``
     - the output root: every result file is ``<out_root>`` plus a suffix (``.out``,
       ``.static.out``, …; see :doc:`outputs`). It may include a directory, which must already
       exist. Existing result files with the same names are replaced.

Exactly two positional arguments are required. Each argument may be at most 4096 characters.

Options
~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Option
     - Effect
   * - ``-v``, ``-V``, ``-version``, ``-VERSION``, ``--version``
     - print the identity banner (name, version, author, licence) to stdout and exit 0
   * - ``-h``, ``-H``, ``-help``, ``-HELP``, ``--help``, ``-?``, ``/?``
     - print the banner and the usage summary to stdout and exit 0

A version or help option is recognised only as the **first** argument; everything after it is
ignored. Any other argument that begins with ``-`` — anywhere on the command line — is an
unknown option: the driver prints ``CableDyn_driver: unknown option "<arg>"`` and the usage to
stderr and exits 1. A deck or output root whose name begins with ``-`` must therefore be given
with a directory prefix (``./-case.dat``).

Checks before the solve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before the deck is solved, the driver rejects, with exit code 1 and a message on stderr:

* a wrong number of arguments (banner and usage are printed to stderr);
* an argument that is empty, cannot be read, or is longer than 4096 characters
  (``CableDyn_driver: argument <i> is longer than 4096 characters``);
* a deck path or output root that cannot be opened exactly: a reserved Windows device name
  (``CON``, ``NUL``, ``COM1``, …) or a path beyond the length limit with no shorter spelling
  (``CableDyn_driver: cannot read deck "<deck>": <reason>`` or ``cannot write output files at
  "<root>": <reason>``; see :doc:`driver_format`, *File names*). Arguments are read as Unicode,
  and the release ``CableDyn_driver.exe`` runs with UTF-8 as its Windows code page (Windows 10
  version 1903 or later), so accented, Hangul, emoji, and mixed-script names are accepted in the
  arguments and in the working folder alike. A driver built from source with the GNU toolchain
  opens a name outside the system ANSI code page through its 8.3 short name and refuses it on a
  volume without short names;
* an output root one of whose result files would be the deck, however spelled
  (``CableDyn_driver: output root "<root>" would overwrite the input deck``), or a file the
  deck reads (``… would overwrite the input file "<file>" that the deck reads``). The check
  covers ``.out``, ``.static.out``, ``.elements.out``, the per-line ``.Line<N>.p.out`` /
  ``.t.out`` / ``.range.out`` and per-rod ``.Rod<N>.p.out`` files, the probe, and the lock.
  The modal table ``.modes.out`` (written only when ``nModes`` is set) is not checked, so do
  not choose an output root whose ``.modes.out`` name is one of your input files;
* an output location that cannot be written — a missing directory or one without write
  permission (``CableDyn_driver: cannot write output files at "<root>" (check that the
  directory exists and is writable)``). The check creates and removes a probe file
  ``<out_root>.write_check.tmp``; an existing file of that name is left in place;
* an output root that another running ``CableDyn_driver`` is writing
  (``CableDyn_driver: another CableDyn run is writing output root "<root>" …``). A run holds
  the lock file ``<out_root>.cabledyn.lock`` from just before its first output until it ends;
  the operating system releases it even when the run is killed, so a stale lock never blocks
  a later run.

Standard streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 16 84

   * - Stream
     - Content
   * - stderr
     - the identity banner (on a solve run); the initialisation report on static, ``EI = 0``
       and finite-EI decks; every diagnostic and error message
   * - stdout
     - the initialisation report on mixed ``EI = 0`` + finite-EI decks; dynamic progress
       (``Dynamic simulation: …`` and ``Progress: …% | t = … s | elapsed … | ETA …``, at 5 %
       intervals); ``Recovery audit: …`` and ``Tensile monitor: …`` summaries;
       ``CableDyn: FAILURE …`` event lines; and, last, the success line

The formats of the report and progress records are shown in :doc:`outputs`. On success the
final stdout line is exactly::

   CableDyn_driver: converged run written to <out_root>.out

stdout is a human-readable log, not a machine-parseable stream: its records vary with the deck
and the route. Automation should rely on the **exit status** and read results from the output
files. To keep only the stdout records, discard stderr (``2>/dev/null`` or ``2>$null``).

Exit codes
~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Code
     - Meaning
   * - ``0``
     - success: the static solve converged and, for a dynamic deck, every step of the march
       converged; all output files were written. Also returned by ``--version`` and ``--help``.
   * - ``1``
     - invalid invocation or input: argument errors, unknown options, the pre-solve checks above,
       any deck parse or validation error (unknown keyword, bad value, unresolved id, unsupported
       feature combination, unreadable auxiliary file), and failure to create an output file
   * - ``2``
     - the solve failed: a static line did not converge (``<out_root>.out`` is still written
       with ``converged=F`` for inspection), a finite-EI static initialisation did not converge
       or was rejected by the ``max(h*kappa)`` folded-branch check or the tensile-safety check, a
       dynamic step did not converge or its linear solve failed (the output holds the committed
       steps only), or a result became non-finite. Also returned before the deck is read when
       a Windows GNU source build cannot load its LAPACK runtime (``openblas.dll``); the
       message names the library, each location tried and the Windows load error. The release
       ``CableDyn_driver.exe`` is statically linked and has no such dependency

Every non-zero exit is accompanied by a message on stderr. See :doc:`troubleshooting` for the
messages and their remedies.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: powershell

   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force results | Out-Null
   .\CableDyn_driver.exe examples\wd0050_chain.dat results\wd0050
   if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { Write-Error "CableDyn failed ($LASTEXITCODE)" }

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p out
   if ./build/cabledyn examples/wd0050_chain.dat out/wd0050 2>err.log; then
       echo "converged"
   else
       echo "failed ($?)"; cat err.log
   fi

:doc:`standalone_driver`.

Python command-line tools
-------------------------

Installing the Python package adds four console commands. They are thin wrappers around the
package API described in :doc:`python` and :doc:`api_python`; they do not replace the native
``CableDyn_driver`` executable, which ``cabledyn-run`` and ``cabledyn-study`` launch as a
subprocess.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 30 50

   * - Command
     - Entry point
     - Purpose
   * - ``cabledyn-run``
     - ``cabledyn.cli:main``
     - Run one standalone deck through the native driver and validate its main output.
   * - ``cabledyn-post``
     - ``cabledyn.post_cli:main``
     - Summarise, export, plot, rainflow-count, or spectrally analyse a result table.
   * - ``cabledyn-deck``
     - ``cabledyn.deck_cli:main``
     - Validate, inspect, edit, or generate variants of an input deck.
   * - ``cabledyn-study``
     - ``cabledyn.study_cli:main``
     - Run every case of a generated ``cases.json`` study and write a study record.

Conventions shared by all four tools:

* Options of ``cabledyn-post`` and ``cabledyn-deck`` belong to the subcommand and are written
  after it (``cabledyn-deck validate deck.dat --caller-driven``).
* ``-h``/``--help`` prints help to stdout and exits with code 0. A usage error (missing
  argument, unknown option, invalid choice, a value that does not convert to the declared type,
  a missing required option) prints the usage line and the error to stderr and exits with
  code 2.
* Handled errors are printed to stderr as a single line ``<prog>: <message>``. Results and
  written file paths go to stdout.
* Output paths are expanded (``~``) and resolved to absolute paths, and missing parent
  directories are created. Decks, CSV tables, and JSON records are written through a temporary
  file in the target directory and then renamed, so an interrupted write never leaves a
  partial file under the requested name. Figures are saved directly by matplotlib.
* An existing output file is never replaced unless ``--overwrite`` is given.
* An unexpected exception outside the handled classes listed for each tool ends the process
  with a Python traceback and exit code 1.

Locating the native driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``cabledyn-run`` and ``cabledyn-study`` find the native executable as follows:

1. If ``--executable PATH`` is given, that file is used and nothing else is tried.
2. Otherwise, if the ``CABLEDYN_DRIVER`` environment variable is set, the file it names is
   used when it exists.
3. Otherwise ``PATH`` is searched for ``CableDyn_driver.exe``, ``CableDyn_driver``, and
   ``cabledyn``, in that order.

On Linux and macOS a direct path (1 or 2) must also be executable. If no candidate is found,
the command fails with ``could not locate CableDyn_driver using ... Tried: ...``, listing every
candidate that was checked.

cabledyn-run
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Runs one complete standalone deck (:doc:`driver_format`) and checks that the solver produced a
readable main output table.

.. code-block:: text

   cabledyn-run [-h] [--executable EXECUTABLE] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--overwrite]
                deck output_root

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 18 15 45

   * - Argument
     - Type
     - Default
     - Meaning
   * - ``deck``
     - path
     - required
     - The sectioned ``.dat`` deck. It must exist. The native process runs with the deck's
       directory as its working directory, so relative ancillary-file references in the deck
       resolve as they do when the driver is run by hand from that directory.
   * - ``output_root``
     - path stem
     - required
     - Output stem without ``.out``; the solver appends the suffixes. A relative stem is
       resolved against the deck's directory, not the current directory. A stem ending in
       ``.out`` or with no file name (``.``, ``..``) is rejected. Missing parent directories
       are created.
   * - ``--executable``
     - path
     - see above
     - Native driver to run (see *Locating the native driver*).
   * - ``--timeout``
     - float, s
     - none
     - Maximum wall-clock time for the solver process; finite and positive (``0``, negative,
       ``inf``, and ``nan`` are rejected before the solver starts). When exceeded the process
       is killed and the command fails. With no value the run is not time-limited.
   * - ``--overwrite``
     - flag
     - off
     - Allow a run whose output files already exist. The previous files are kept aside until
       the new run succeeds (see *Files written*).

**Files written.** The native driver writes ``<root>.out`` and, depending on the deck,
``<root>.static.out``, ``<root>.elements.out``, ``<root>.Line<N>.p.out``,
``<root>.Line<N>.t.out``, ``<root>.Line<N>.range.out``, ``<root>.Rod<N>.p.out`` and
``<root>.modes.out`` (see :doc:`outputs`). If any of ``<root>.out``, ``<root>.static.out``,
``<root>.elements.out``, or a ``.Line<N>.p.out``, ``.Line<N>.t.out`` or ``.Rod<N>.p.out`` file
of that root already exists, the run is refused unless ``--overwrite`` is given. The range
graphs ``.Line<N>.range.out`` and the modal table ``.modes.out`` are not part of this check: an
existing file of that name is replaced by the new run and is not restored if it fails. With
``--overwrite`` the previous files are moved into a temporary directory
``.<stem>.previous-<random>`` beside them while the solver runs. They are deleted once the new
run has succeeded; if the rerun fails for any reason (non-zero exit, timeout, missing or
malformed main output, or an interruption), the partial new files are removed and the previous
results are restored unchanged.

**Streams.** On success, stdout receives exactly one line: the absolute path of ``<root>.out``.
The solver's own stdout and stderr are captured and not echoed. On failure, stderr receives
``cabledyn-run: <message>``; when the native process fails, the message contains its exit code
and its captured stderr (or stdout, if stderr is empty).

**Exit codes.**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Code
     - Meaning
   * - 0
     - The native driver exited with code 0 (the driver reserves 0 for a fully converged
       analysis), ``<root>.out`` exists, and it parsed as a valid table.
   * - 1
     - Handled failure: executable not found; deck missing; invalid output stem; outputs exist
       without ``--overwrite``; the native process exited non-zero; the timeout expired; the
       process exited 0 but ``<root>.out`` is missing or malformed; or another operating-system
       error.
   * - 2
     - Command-line usage error (argparse).

Example:

.. code-block:: text

   cabledyn-run lazy_wave.dat results/lw_dlc11 --timeout 3600 --overwrite

This writes ``results/lw_dlc11.out`` (and any auxiliary files) next to ``lazy_wave.dat`` and
prints the absolute path of the main output.

cabledyn-post
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reads one CableDyn result table (:doc:`outputs`) and summarises, exports, plots, or analyses it,
or compares two time histories. The file type is detected from its header: a table whose first
column is ``Time`` or ``Time(s)`` is a time history (a ``.Line<N>.p.out`` or ``.Line<N>.t.out``
time history is a dynamic per-line node-position or segment-tension history); a table with
``LineID``, ``Node``, and ``ArcLength`` columns is a static profile; anything else is a generic
table.

Results of other tools are read with the readers described in :doc:`python_postprocessing`,
chosen from the file name: ``*.outb`` is an OpenFAST binary file, ``*.MD.Line<N>.out`` a
MoorDyn line file, ``*.MD.out`` a MoorDyn main file, and anything else (including OpenFAST text
``.out`` and coupled ``*.CD.out`` files) the CableDyn reader. Every subcommand accepts
``--format {auto,cabledyn,openfast,moordyn,moordyn-line}`` to override that choice.

.. code-block:: text

   cabledyn-post [-h] {summary,export,plot,fatigue,spectrum,coherence,compare} ...

                          [--percentile P] [--no-unit-check] [--output CSV] [--overwrite]

A subcommand is required. Channel names are matched exactly (case-sensitive) against the table
header, for example ``FairTen1`` or ``Tension``. Period limits ``--start``/``--stop`` select the
closed interval ``[start, stop]`` in seconds; they must be finite, ``start`` must not exceed
``stop``, and the interval must contain at least one sample.

Plotting (``plot``, and ``--plot-output`` of ``fatigue``, ``spectrum``, ``coherence``) needs
matplotlib (``pip install "cabledyn[plot]"``). Figures are saved with the format implied by the
file suffix (``.png``, ``.pdf``, ``.svg``, ...).

Output on stdout, as ``key: value`` lines:

* **Static profile**: per line, ``line_id``, ``node_count``, ``deformed_length`` (final
  ``ArcLength``), ``minimum_tension``, ``maximum_tension``, ``maximum_curvature``,
  ``minimum_bend_radius`` (``1/maximum_curvature``; ``inf`` for zero curvature), and
  ``maximum_bend_moment`` (largest absolute ``BendMoment``), in the units of the source columns.
  A quantity whose column is absent prints ``None``. Lines are separated by a blank line.
* **Time history**: ``samples``, ``time_start``, ``time_stop``, then for every non-time channel
  a blank line and ``channel``, ``unit``, ``count``, ``minimum``, ``maximum``, ``mean``,

* **Generic table**: ``rows`` and a comma-separated ``channels`` list.

export
^^^^^^

Writes a table that pyDatView reads directly: one header row of ``Name_[unit]`` labels followed
by the values with 17 significant digits. A ``.csv`` suffix produces comma-separated text; any
other suffix produces tab-separated text.

fatigue
^^^^^^^

Rainflow-counts one time-history channel (cycle ranges, not amplitudes) and computes the
uncorrected damage-equivalent range

.. math::

   S_\mathrm{eq} = \left(\frac{\sum_i n_i S_i^{m}}{N_\mathrm{eq}}\right)^{1/m},

where :math:`n_i` is the cycle weight (0.5 or 1), :math:`S_i` the cycle range, and
:math:`N_\mathrm{eq}` the reference cycle count. No mean-stress or other correction is applied.

     - one of the two is required
     - Equivalent-cycle frequency; :math:`N_\mathrm{eq}` = frequency x selected record
       duration. Finite and positive.
   * - ``--start``, ``--stop``
     - float, s
     - whole record
     - Analysis period; at least two samples are required.
   * - ``--bins``
     - int
     - 32 when a histogram or plot is requested
     - Number of equal-width range bins spanning 0 to the largest cycle range; must be
       positive.
   * - ``--cycles-output``
     - path
     - none
     - Write every rainflow cycle as CSV: ``count_[-]``, ``range_[unit]``, ``mean_[unit]``,
       ``start_index_[-]``, ``end_index_[-]``, ``start_time_[s]``, ``end_time_[s]``.
   * - ``--histogram-output``
     - path
     - none
     - Write the range histogram as CSV: ``range_lower``, ``range_upper``, ``range_center``
       (channel unit) and ``count_[-]`` (weighted cycles).
   * - ``--plot-output``
     - path
     - none
     - Save a histogram bar chart.
   * - ``--overwrite``
     - flag
     - off
     - Replace existing output files.

All requested output paths are checked before any calculation: each must differ from the source
file and, without ``--overwrite``, must not exist. stdout then receives ``channel``,
``source``, ``unit``, ``sample_count``, ``start_time``, ``end_time``, ``duration``,
``wohler_exponent``, ``reference_cycles``, ``equivalent_frequency``, ``cycle_count``, and
``damage_equivalent_range``, followed by the path of each file written. A record with no load
cycles yields a ``damage_equivalent_range`` of 0, still writes ``--cycles-output`` (header
only), and prints ``histogram: not written (the selected record contains no load cycles)``
instead of writing the histogram or plot.

spectrum
^^^^^^^^

Computes a one-sided Welch power spectral density of one channel. The record must be uniformly
sampled (time-step deviation within a relative tolerance of 1e-6 of the median step); it is
never resampled.

Spectral options shared with ``coherence``:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 18 15 45

   * - Option
     - Type
     - Default
     - Meaning
   * - ``--segment-length``
     - int
     - required
     - Samples per Welch segment; at least 2 and no more than the selected sample count. It is
       never shortened automatically.
   * - ``--overlap``
     - float
     - ``0.5``
     - Overlap fraction in [0, 1); overlap samples = floor(overlap x segment length).
   * - ``--fft-length``
     - int
     - segment length
     - FFT length (zero padding); at least the segment length.
   * - ``--window``
     - ``hann``, ``boxcar``
     - ``hann``
     - Segment window.
   * - ``--detrend``
     - ``constant``, ``none``
     - ``constant``
     - ``constant`` removes each segment's mean.
   * - ``--start``, ``--stop``
     - float, s
     - whole record
     - Analysis period.
   * - ``--output``
     - path
     - none
     - Write a CSV of the result.
   * - ``--plot-output``
     - path
     - none
     - Save a figure.
   * - ``--overwrite``
     - flag
     - off
     - Replace existing ``--output``/``--plot-output`` files.

Options specific to ``spectrum``:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 18 15 45

   * - Option
     - Type
     - Default
     - Meaning
   * - ``channel``
     - string
     - required
     - Channel to analyse; must not be the time channel.
   * - ``--moment``
     - float, repeatable
     - none
     - Spectral-moment order :math:`k`; integrates :math:`f^k S(f)` over the band. The band
       must contain at least two bins.
   * - ``--min-frequency``
     - float, Hz
     - first bin
     - Lower band limit for moments and peaks. When omitted and any requested order is
       negative, the first non-zero bin is used (a negative order cannot include 0 Hz).
   * - ``--max-frequency``
     - float, Hz
     - last bin
     - Upper band limit for moments and peaks.
   * - ``--peaks``
     - int
     - ``1``
     - Number of strongest local-maximum bins to report (at least 1). The 0 Hz bin is never
       reported as a peak; fewer lines are printed if fewer maxima exist.
   * - ``--logarithmic``
     - flag
     - off
     - Logarithmic PSD axis in ``--plot-output``.

Every requested quantity is evaluated before anything is printed, so an invalid request fails
without partial output. stdout receives ``channel``, ``source``, ``unit``, ``density_unit``,
``start_time``, ``end_time``, ``sample_interval``, ``sample_count``, ``segment_length``,
``overlap_samples``, ``fft_length``, ``segment_count``, ``window``, ``detrend``,
``uniform_rtol``, ``uniform_atol``, ``frequency_resolution``; then ``moment_<k>`` and
``moment_<k>_unit`` per requested order; then ``peak_<r>_frequency`` and ``peak_<r>_density``
per peak; then the paths of written files. The CSV has the columns ``frequency_[Hz]`` and
``PSD_[<density unit>]``, where the density unit is the channel unit squared per hertz (plain
``PSD`` when the channel has no unit).

coherence
^^^^^^^^^

Computes the magnitude-squared Welch coherence of two channels, using the spectral options
above. At least two complete Welch segments are required. A frequency bin is *valid* only where
both auto-spectra exceed ``--power-floor-ratio`` times their own maximum; invalid bins carry no
coherence value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 18 15 45

   * - Option
     - Type
     - Default
     - Meaning
   * - ``channel_x``, ``channel_y``
     - string
     - required
     - Two distinct non-time channels.
   * - ``--power-floor-ratio``
     - float
     - 100 x machine epsilon (about 2.2e-14)
     - Relative auto-spectrum floor, in [0, 1).

stdout receives ``channel_x``, ``channel_y``, ``source``, ``start_time``, ``end_time``,
``sample_interval``, ``sample_count``, ``segment_length``, ``overlap_samples``,
``fft_length``, ``segment_count``, ``window``, ``detrend``, ``uniform_rtol``,
``uniform_atol``, ``power_floor_ratio``, ``valid_bins``, ``invalid_bins``, then the paths of
written files. The CSV has the columns ``frequency_[Hz]``, ``coherence_[-]`` (empty for invalid
bins), and ``valid_[-]`` (1 or 0).

``compare``
^^^^^^^^^^^

Compares a candidate time history with a reference channel by channel on the interval both
cover, interpolating linearly onto one of the two time grids and never extrapolating
(:func:`cabledyn.compare_histories`).

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 18 15 45

   * - Option
     - Type
     - Default
     - Meaning
   * - ``reference``, ``candidate``
     - path
     - required
     - Two time-history files, read with the same ``--format``.
   * - ``--channel``
     - ``NAME`` or ``REF=CAND``, repeatable
     - every shared name
     - Channel pairs to compare; ``FAIRTEN1=FairTen1`` pairs differently named channels.
   * - ``--start``, ``--stop``
     - float, s
     - shared interval
     - Narrow the compared period.
   * - ``--grid``
     - ``reference`` or ``candidate``
     - ``reference``
     - Time grid the other record is interpolated onto.
   * - ``--percentile``
     - float in [0, 100]
     - 95
     - Percentile whose change is reported.
   * - ``--no-unit-check``
     - flag
     - off
     - Compare channels whose recorded units differ.
   * - ``--output``
     - path
     - none
     - Write one CSV row of metrics per channel (refused if it names either input).
   * - ``--overwrite``
     - flag
     - off
     - Replace an existing ``--output`` file.

stdout receives ``reference``, ``candidate``, ``time_start``, ``time_stop``, ``samples``, and
``percentile``, then one block per channel with ``channel``, ``candidate_channel``, ``unit``,
``count``, ``max_abs_difference``, ``mean_difference``, ``rms_difference``,
``normalized_rms_difference``, ``relative_max_difference``, ``correlation``,
``reference_maximum``, ``candidate_maximum``, ``maximum_delta``, ``minimum_delta``,
``mean_delta``, ``standard_deviation_delta``, and ``percentile_delta``
(``difference = candidate - reference``), then the path of the CSV when written.

cabledyn-deck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Validates, inspects, edits, and generates variants of a CableDyn input deck
(:doc:`driver_format`). Editing preserves every untouched row, comment, and byte of the source;
an edited row is re-rendered with single spaces between its data tokens while its indentation
and trailing commentary are kept. Every deck read and every result is validated against the
native reader's rules.

     - New value. Parsed as JSON when possible (number, string, ``true``/``false``, or list);
       otherwise used as a plain string. JSON ``null`` and objects are rejected. Negative
       numbers such as ``-1e-3`` are accepted as values rather than options.
   * - ``spec``

**Selectors.** Selector keywords, field names, and line-type names are case-insensitive.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Selector
     - Addresses
   * - ``option.KEY``
     - The effective (last) row of an existing ``OPTIONS`` keyword, including native aliases.
       A list value sets several values (``dynamic_solver`` and the positional ``waves`` and
       ``current`` forms); other options take one value. A missing option is an error; the
       editor does not add rows.
   * - ``point.ID.FIELD``
     - ``POINTS`` row ``ID``; fields ``id``, ``type``, ``x``, ``y``, ``z``, ``mass``, ``vol``,
       ``cda``, ``ca``.
   * - ``line_type.NAME.FIELD``
     - ``LINE TYPES`` row ``NAME``; fields ``name``, ``diam``, ``mass``, ``ea``, ``ba``,
       ``ei`` followed by ``cdn``, ``cdt``, ``can``, ``cat`` (CableDyn columns), ``cd``,
       ``ca``, ``cdax``, ``caax`` (MoorDyn-style columns), or ``gas``, ``gj``, ``irt``,
       ``irn``, ``cdn``, ``cdt``, ``can``, ``cat`` (14-column rows).
   * - ``section.LINE.OCCURRENCE.FIELD``
     - The ``OCCURRENCE``-th section (1-based, End A to End B) of line ``LINE``; fields
       ``lineid``, ``linetype``, ``length``, ``numsegs``. A 7-column ``LINES`` row counts as a
       section at its position and takes ``lineid``, ``linetype``, ``nodea``, ``nodeb``,
       ``length``, ``numsegs``, ``outputs``.
   * - ``end_connection.LINE.END.FIELD``
     - ``END CONNECTIONS`` row for line ``LINE`` and end ``A``/``B`` (also ``EndA``,
       ``End_A``, ...); fields ``lineid``, ``end``, ``stiffness``, ``ezx``, ``ezy``, ``ezz``.

Values are written as single native tokens: integers as given, floating-point numbers with 17
significant digits (``0.1`` is written ``0.10000000000000001`` and ``1.0`` as ``1``), and
Booleans as ``True``/``False``. To write a number exactly as typed, pass it as a JSON string,
for example ``'"0.1"'``. Values containing whitespace, quotes, or comment markers are rejected.
An edit that would make the deck invalid is rejected and nothing is written.

**Subcommand behaviour and output.**

* ``validate`` prints ``valid: <absolute deck path>``.
* ``show`` prints ``deck``, then the counts ``line_types``, ``points``, ``lines``,
  ``sections``, ``end_connections``, ``options`` (option rows, including repeated keywords),
  and ``outputs`` (output channels).
* ``set`` applies one selector and prints the absolute path of ``output``. An ``output`` that is
  the source deck (by path, hard link, or case-insensitive alias) is refused with exit code 1,
  even with ``--overwrite``.
* ``generate`` builds and validates every case before writing any file, then writes
  ``<output_directory>/<case>.dat`` per case and ``<output_directory>/cases.json``, and prints
  each generated deck path. Case names must match ``[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*`` and be unique
  ignoring case, and the mapping must not be empty. Relative references to ancillary files
  (``SYROPE:`` working-curve files and the bathymetry/seafloor, motion, and wave-kinematics
  file options) are rewritten so they still resolve from the output directory. Without
  ``--overwrite``, the command fails if any target ``.dat`` or ``cases.json`` exists; other
  files in the directory are left alone. A target that is the source deck is always refused.

``cases.json`` (schema ``cabledyn-deck-cases-v1``) records the absolute source path, its
SHA-256, ``caller_driven``, and for each case its name, absolute deck path, deck SHA-256,
working directory, and the applied changes. ``cabledyn-study`` checks these digests, so a study
directory must not be moved or edited after generation.

**Exit codes.**

Runs every case of a ``cases.json`` written by ``cabledyn-deck generate`` through the native

     - Destination for all results; created if missing.

     - Number of native processes run concurrently; must be positive.
   * - ``--timeout``

       recorded as failed.
   * - ``--channel``

     - every non-time channel
     - Main-output channel to summarise. Names must be non-empty and unique.
   * - ``--start``, ``--stop``
     - float, s
     - whole record
     - Statistics period; finite, with ``start`` not exceeding ``stop``.
   * - ``--overwrite``
     - flag
     - off
     - Allow a non-empty output directory. Existing result files of a case are replaced only
       when that case succeeds; a failed case restores them (as for ``cabledyn-run
       --overwrite``). Other files are left alone.

**Preflight.** Before any solver process starts, the command verifies the manifest schema, that
the source deck and every generated deck exist and match their recorded SHA-256, that case names
are safe and unique and deck paths distinct, that no case name collides with the output files
of another case (for example ``base`` and ``base.static``), and the option values above. It
refuses a non-empty output directory without ``--overwrite``, locates the driver, records its
SHA-256, and queries its ``--version`` banner (10 s limit).

**Files written** in the output directory:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - File
     - Content
   * - ``<case>.out`` and auxiliary files
     - Native results for each case, with output root ``<case>`` (see :doc:`outputs`).
   * - ``<case>.stdout.log``, ``<case>.stderr.log``
     - The complete captured native streams, written for every case, including failures.
   * - ``summary.csv``
     - One row per case and summarised channel with the columns ``case``, ``status``,
       ``elapsed_seconds``, ``channel``, ``unit``, ``count``, ``minimum``, ``maximum``,
       ``mean``, ``standard_deviation`` (population), ``rms``, ``error``. A case with no
       statistics keeps one row with empty statistic columns.
   * - ``study.json``
     - Schema ``cabledyn-study-results-v1``: manifest path and SHA-256, executable path and
       SHA-256, solver version banner, UTC start and finish times, ``jobs``, ``timeout``,
       ``period``, ``channels``, and per case its status, deck and digest, output paths, log
       paths, elapsed time, native return code, and error.

Each case ends with one of three statuses: ``completed`` (native exit 0 and statistics
computed), ``failed`` (the native process exited non-zero, timed out, or could not be started),
or ``postprocess_failed`` (the solver finished but its main output was missing or invalid, the
statistics failed, for example for an unknown ``--channel`` or an empty period, or the case
otherwise completed but one of its log files could not be written).

**Streams.** stdout receives one line per case in manifest order, ``<case>: <status>``
followed by ``: <diagnostic>`` for any case that recorded an error, then ``study_manifest: <path>``
and
``summary_csv: <path>``. Errors that stop the study go to stderr as
``cabledyn-study: <message>``.

       and logs already written are kept; the stderr message names the file that failed.
       The Python API raises ``StudyOutputError`` (an ``OSError`` subclass) in this case.

Interrupting the command (Ctrl+C) cancels cases that have not started, waits for running cases,
and exits with a Python traceback without writing ``summary.csv`` or ``study.json``.
