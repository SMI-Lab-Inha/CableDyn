# Developing CableDyn

This guide is for developers who build and test CableDyn from source. It lists the
commands for the environment, build, tests, Python package, documentation, and
integration with OpenFAST, maintained by NLR (National Laboratory of the Rockies,
formerly NREL). Contribution rules are in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/SMI-Lab-Inha/CableDyn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md);
the release procedure is in
[RELEASE.md](https://github.com/SMI-Lab-Inha/CableDyn/blob/main/RELEASE.md).

## Environment

Requirements: conda (Miniconda, Miniforge, or Anaconda) on Linux, macOS, or
Windows, and git. `environment.yml` provides conda-forge gfortran, a C compiler,
CMake, Ninja, Make, OpenBLAS/LAPACK, Python, and the developer tools
(`pre-commit`, `fprettify`). Do not mix the conda gfortran with a system gfortran
or Intel IFX.

```powershell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cabledyn
pre-commit install
```

## Build and test

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build -L fortran -LE slow --output-on-failure   # fast tier
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure                       # full suite
```

The standalone driver is `build/cabledyn` (`build\bin\cabledyn.exe` with the conda
toolchain on Windows, where CMake stages the runtime DLLs and every executable in
`build\bin`); a build with an MSVC-style linker (Intel IFX) and the static release
build name the same program `CableDyn_driver.exe`. On Windows, add
`-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc` if CMake would otherwise pick a Visual Studio C compiler, so the
C sources build with the conda MinGW `gcc` that matches `gfortran` (as CI does).
The Debug configuration (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`) adds `-fcheck=all
-fbacktrace`. CMake finds LAPACK with `find_package(LAPACK)` and falls back to the
conda OpenBLAS through `CONDA_PREFIX`. `cmake --install build --prefix stage`
installs the driver, the shared library, and `CableDyn_CAPI.h`.

A Windows build with gfortran links every executable with a 64 MiB stack reserve
(the MinGW default is 2 MiB). With OpenMP enabled, gfortran keeps fixed-size local
arrays on the stack, and the stack depth of the OpenBLAS kernels differs between
CPUs, so a small reserve can pass on one machine and overflow on another. The
shared library cannot rely on this reserve: the host program (for example
`python.exe`, which reserves about 2 MB) sets the stack of the threads that call
it. The `-L stack` tests check the library on a thread with a 1 MiB stack and, in
a Windows gfortran build, the driver and the modal test relinked with a 1 MiB
reserve and the reserve written into each executable.

| Selection | Tests |
|---|---|
| `-L fortran` | All Fortran tests |
| `-L fortran -LE slow` | Fast tier |
| `-L slow` | Long validation cases |
| `-L l1` | The 10 analytical cases |
| `-L static`, `-L dynamic` | Static and dynamic solver tests |
| `-L integration` | End-to-end driver and aggregate tests |
| `-L openfast` | OpenFAST shell and aggregate tests |
| `-L external_ref` | IEA-15MW VolturnUS-S mooring comparisons |
| `-L cosserat` | Secondary Cosserat path |
| `-L python` | Python package, deck-style, and documentation checks |
| `-L stack` | Library, driver, and modal test on a 1 MiB stack |

A test program can also be run directly from the build tree (`build/`, or
`build\bin\` with the conda toolchain on Windows); it prints `PASS:` or
stops at the first mismatch. The Fortran CI workflow builds Release and Debug on
Ubuntu and Windows and runs the full suite on every pull request and push to
`main`.

## Python package

The `cabledyn` package (`python/`) loads the C-ABI shared library built by
`cmake --build build --target cabledyn_shared`. The `python_package` CTest runs its
tests when the configured Python has `numpy` and `pytest`. To work on the package
directly:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".\python[dev]"
$env:CABLEDYN_LIBRARY = "<path to the built libcabledyn shared library>"
python -m pytest python/tests -q
cd python; python -m ruff check cabledyn tests; python -m ruff format --check cabledyn tests; python -m mypy; cd ..
```

The fatigue (`test_fatigue.py`) and spectral (`test_spectra.py`) tests do not load
the shared library. They compare against independent references (the ASTM E1049
cycle table and analytical sinusoids); do not replace these with snapshots of
CableDyn output.

On Windows, run Python from the activated `cabledyn` environment and point
`CABLEDYN_LIBRARY` at the DLL. Do not prepend compiler or OpenBLAS runtime
directories to `PATH` before importing NumPy: mixed runtime DLLs can terminate
Python during NumPy initialisation.

## Documentation

```powershell
python -m pip install -r doc/requirements.txt
python -m sphinx -W --keep-going -n -b html doc doc/_build/html
python tests/test_documentation.py
```

Markdown files outside `doc/` that the manual includes (`CHANGELOG.md`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `VALIDATION.md`) must link to repository
files with absolute `https://github.com/SMI-Lab-Inha/CableDyn/blob/main/...`
URLs.

## Formatting and checks

```powershell
pre-commit run --all-files
fprettify --indent 2 --line-length 120 src/<file>.f90
```

The hooks check whitespace, end-of-file, merge markers, YAML, large files, Fortran
formatting (`fprettify`; `src/openfast/` is excluded), Python lint and formatting (`ruff`),
and release metadata.
Fortran lines longer than 120 columns must be split with `&` before formatting.

## Coding standards

### Fortran

- Fortran 2018, free form, `IMPLICIT NONE` in every program unit.
- Real kind `wp` from `CableDyn_Precision`; never `REAL*8` or `DOUBLE PRECISION`.
- Modules are named `CableDyn_<Function>`; subroutines `CD_<Action>_<Object>`
  (for example `CD_Assemble_Cable_Mass`).
- Public subroutines take `ErrStat (INTEGER, INTENT(OUT))` and
  `ErrMsg (CHARACTER(*), INTENT(OUT))`.
- LAPACK: banded solvers (`DGBSV`, and `DPBTRF`/`DPBTRS` for symmetric positive
  definite bands); a dense assembly is packed into band storage before the solve.
- Warning-clean under `-std=f2018 -Wall -Wextra -fimplicit-none`.
- Keep large data off the stack: a local array or derived-type variable that can
  exceed about 64 KB is `ALLOCATABLE`, except on the per-step path, which uses the
  preallocated workspaces and does not allocate.

### SPDX headers

Every source file starts with:

```text

Use the comment syntax of the language (`#` for Python, PowerShell, and YAML).

## OpenFAST integration

The OpenFAST host module in `src/openfast/` compiles only inside an OpenFAST
source tree. To build and check it locally:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast.git <openfast>
git -C <openfast> checkout 2895884d2be01862173c88d70f86b358d2f1a50a
./integration/openfast/prepare_openfast_source.ps1 -OpenFASTRoot <openfast>
cmake -S <openfast> -B <openfast-build-dir> -DCABLEDYN_ROOT=<CableDyn checkout>
powershell -File integration/openfast/openfast_build_gate.ps1 -BuildDir <openfast-build-dir> -CaseFst <case.fst>
```

`openfast_build_gate.ps1` builds `openfast.exe`, runs a `CompMooring = 5` case,
checks that the CableDyn banner appears in the log, and checks that the output is
finite.

An `openfast.exe` built this way through CMake does not embed the UTF-8
active-code-page manifest (`app/utf8_code_page.manifest`), so on Windows it may not
open input files in folders whose names the system code page cannot spell. The
static release build (`release/build_static_windows.ps1`, which uses the OpenFAST
Visual Studio solution) embeds the manifest. See
[integration/openfast/README.md](https://github.com/SMI-Lab-Inha/CableDyn/blob/main/integration/openfast/README.md)
for details.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `gfortran` not found | environment not activated | `conda activate cabledyn` |
| `find_package(LAPACK)` fails | no system LAPACK | install `liblapack-dev`, or build inside the conda environment |
| Python exits while importing NumPy on Windows | runtime DLL directories on `PATH` | remove them from `PATH`; set `CABLEDYN_LIBRARY` instead |
| Windows checkout differs from CI | CRLF line endings | `.gitattributes` enforces LF; run `git add --renormalize .` |
