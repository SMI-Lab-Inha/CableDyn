# Reproduction of the journal article

This record is for readers of the CableDyn journal article (Seo et al., *Ocean Engineering*
368 (Part 2), 128332, 2026) who want to know whether the current release reproduces its numbers. The article
records the formulation as published. CableDyn keeps developing, and its defaults follow the
most accurate and robust methods available. The article's methods stay selectable. The table
lists every quantitative result in the article that CableDyn computes, re-run with the v0.1.0
release in two modes.

| Mode | Settings |
| --- | --- |
| Paper mode | `False alpha_force_blend`: forces evaluated at the generalised-α blended configuration, as in the article. `sequenced cable_statics`: the mesh-sequenced static route runs first. End tensions are the end element's axial tension. |
| Defaults | Force-blended generalised-α (`True alpha_force_blend`). Static route starts from a catenary with continuation of the bending stiffness (`continuation cable_statics`). `FairTen`/`AnchTen` report the end force: the end element's force including axial damping, plus the end node's share of weight, seabed contact and drag at the actual velocity, without the end node's inertia. |

The two options apply to finite-EI cables only. Tension-only (EI = 0) lines use the same
solver in both modes, so for moorings the two columns differ only in the reported end
tension. Reference values from OrcaFlex, MoorDyn and closed-form solutions are the fixed values
used in the article; they were not re-run. The source revision recorded in the article's
provenance files, built with the same toolchain, regenerates the article's data files exactly,
so any difference in the paper-mode column comes from a change in CableDyn itself.

**Outcome.** Of the 58 results, paper mode reproduces 53 within the article's printed
precision. Three differ because of later robustness fixes, one of them only in the last
printed digit. Two cannot be reproduced from the
recorded inputs, even with the article's own source: the 800 m pretension and the count of
subdivided mooring motions. With the defaults, 16 results change because of a changed
default. One robustness result is worse with the defaults; see
[Known difference](#known-difference). For moorings, the defaults column also shows the
end-force channel where the article reported the end element's tension. For the dynamic
mooring cases, the end force is evaluated on the same run from the documented `FairTen`
definition. All runs used the
article's full durations, including the one-hour mooring case.

Status codes in the notes: **R** reproduced; **D** changed by an intentional default (paper
mode reproduces); **F** changed by a robustness fix; **X** not reproducible from the recorded
inputs; **W** worse agreement or robustness with the defaults.

The table covers every result the article prints from a CableDyn calculation. Values derived
only from reference codes are not listed: the MoorDyn-F native-mesh difference, its refinement
and settlement study, and the 0.5 ms MoorDyn-F step.

## Known difference

**Cable motion envelope with the default force blend.** The article's envelope protocol
advances each 0.05 s interval with a single generalised-α step at a standalone tolerance of
`1e-3`, with no internal subdivision. In paper mode all 30 gated cases complete, as in the
article. With the default force blend, 2 of the 30 stop on a non-converged step: heave at
80 m (10 m, 14 s and 5 m, 7 s). The 15 m margin probes at 80 and 200 m also stop; in paper
mode only the 200 m probe does.

Root cause: the Hermite step tangent is inexact. It holds added mass over the step and omits
the wave-field gradient, so Newton reaches a residual plateau and stops. Under the force blend
this plateau can lie above the tolerance on steps the configuration blend completes. In the
80 m, 5 m, 7 s case, step 61 stagnates at a scaled residual of 1.23e-3, above the `1e-3`
tolerance; paper mode completes the case.

The release's production step (`CD_HermiteCable_Dyn_Step_Recovering`, used by the standalone
driver and the module for OpenFAST, maintained by NLR, the National Laboratory of the Rockies,
formerly NREL) subdivides such intervals. With it, all 30 gated cases and all
six margin probes complete in both modes. The defaults subdivide 6 intervals in 5 cases, and
paper mode 4 intervals in 4 cases. The solver is not broken, but under the article's
single-step protocol the default scheme has less convergence margin.

**Hang-off curvature near an unresolved boundary layer.** This is not an article result. At
the 800 m hang-off node, where the article reports η_b = 1.63 and omits the bend moment, the
maximum dynamic curvature is 1.6e-3 /m with the defaults and 1.3e-4 /m in paper mode. The
sag-bend peak and the interior profile are unaffected. The curvature near a pinned hang-off is a
boundary-layer quantity and depends strongly on the time step. In a 3 m, 12 s heave it converges
only at Δt ≤ 0.025 s (800 m) and Δt ≤ 0.0125 s (200 m), with the mesh graded toward the end; at
the article's 0.05 s both blends overstate it, by 1.6–2.3 times at 1 m from the end and up to 37
times at the pinned node, whose exact curvature is zero. The sag-bend peak is converged at
0.05 s. Report end curvature 1–2 m from a pinned end after a time-step study, as described in
the [modelling guide](https://cabledyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeling.html).

## How to reproduce

Build the release as described in the
[development guide](https://github.com/SMI-Lab-Inha/CableDyn/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

**Test programs.** Run the test programs from `build` unless noted. Where the article used an
output file, pass its name as the first argument. The programs print every scored value. The
executables are in `build/` on Linux and macOS; Windows builds with the conda GNU toolchain
put them, with the runtime DLLs, in `build/bin/`. Set `BIN` to match:

```bash
BIN=.      # Linux and macOS; use BIN=bin for a Windows GNU build
cd build
$BIN/test_l3_lazywave_dynamic lazywave_solver_evidence.csv                     # paper mode
CD_L3_FORCE_BLEND=1 $BIN/test_l3_lazywave_dynamic lazywave_solver_evidence.csv # defaults
$BIN/test_l3_lazywave_irregular irregular_wave_cable_comparison.dat TABLE.dat  # see below
$BIN/test_l3_orcaflex_wave_dynamic regular_wave_chain_comparison.dat
$BIN/test_snap_load time_step_snap.dat
$BIN/test_viscoelastic polyester_working_ramp.dat
$BIN/test_syrope polyester_syrope_validation.dat
$BIN/test_l2_chain_parity; $BIN/test_l3_orcaflex_current_static; $BIN/test_l3_longduration_mooring
$BIN/test_l2_lozon80_mooring; $BIN/test_l2_lozon200_semitaut
$BIN/test_l3_lazywave_3d_dynamic; $BIN/test_l3_lazywave_touchdown_dynamic
$BIN/test_l4_lazywave_coupled
cd .. && build/$BIN/test_l2_2_dynamic_parity WD0050/A1  # also A2, WD0200/A1..A2, WD0600/A1..A2
```

The L1 programs (`test_l1_*`) give the elementary-mechanics results.

**Irregular-sea comparison.** The article drove both codes with OrcaFlex's own 78-component
JONSWAP realisation. OrcaFlex output is not redistributed, so OrcaFlex licence holders
regenerate that table with
`python validation/scripts/orcaflex_lazywave_irregular_reference.py --orcaflex-jonswap TABLE.dat`
and pass it as the second argument; the program checks the table and scores the article's
OrcaFlex values. Without the table it runs CableDyn's own seeded sea against its OrcaFlex
summary values.

**Paper mode in other test programs.** Apart from `test_l3_lazywave_dynamic`, the Hermite
dynamic test programs use the default force blend. For paper mode, add
`CALL CD_HermiteCable_Dyn_Set_ForceBlend(model, .FALSE., es, em)` after
`CD_HermiteCable_Dyn_Init`. This applies to `test_l3_lazywave_irregular`,
`test_l3_lazywave_3d_dynamic`, `test_l3_lazywave_touchdown_dynamic`,
`test_l4_lazywave_coupled`, `test_l1_hermite_beam_vibration` and
`test_l1_hermite_energy_stability`.

**Deck runs.** The static cable profiles use the example decks, which carry the article's
refined meshes (1024, 952 and 1024 elements):

```bash
mkdir -p out    # the driver does not create output folders
build/$BIN/cabledyn examples/lozon_gomex80_power_cable.dat out/cable_80
```

With the release executable, run `CableDyn_driver.exe` (`.\CableDyn_driver.exe` in PowerShell)
in place of `build/$BIN/cabledyn`.

For paper mode, add these rows to `OPTIONS`:

```text
sequenced cable_statics
False     alpha_force_blend
```

`alpha_force_blend` matters only for dynamic runs. For the quadrature and refinement study, use
the article's starting meshes:

| Cable | Segments per section | Multiples run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 80 m | 28 / 20 / 16 | 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 |
| 200 m | 58 / 20 / 41 | 1, 2, 4, 8 |
| 800 m | 128 / 128 / 256 | 1, 2 |

Add these rows to `OPTIONS`:

```text
False tensile_safety
4     axial_quadrature_order
4     bending_quadrature_order
```

Read the continuous extrema from `<root>.elements.out`.

**Mooring end tensions.** For the moorings, set the line's `Outputs` field to `pt`. Segment 1
of `<root>.Line1.t.out` is the article's end-element tension; `FairTen` in `<root>.out` is the
end force.
