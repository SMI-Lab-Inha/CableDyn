MODULE CableDyn_Catenary
  !! Independent analytical catenary initial guess for the positions-only EI=0
  !! cable path -- the robust static-initialisation seed that, with the load
  !! continuation in CableDyn_Static, lets the grounded / slack regimes converge
  !! without a hand-supplied shape. Positions only (the EI=0 state carries no
  !! rotations).
  !!
  !! The construction is per segment, so each element carries its own axial
  !! stiffness EA and signed submerged weight (positive = downward, negative =
  !! buoyant). A buoyant segment flips the integrated vertical tension and so can
  !! build a lazy-wave turning point. The seed is the exact elastic catenary in the
  !! vertical plane through the endpoints, on a frictionless planar seabed
  !! z_b(x) = z_bed + m x (by default the horizontal plane through the anchor).
  !!
  !! Anchor on the seabed: two endpoint equations close two unknowns, the horizontal
  !! tension H and one complementarity coordinate s. For s >= 0 the line has a
  !! grounded run of reference length s along the seabed and lifts off tangent to
  !! it; for s < 0 nothing is grounded and the anchor tangent is steeper than the bed
  !! by the uplift -s*w_ref >= 0. The branches meet continuously at s = 0, so one
  !! bounded Levenberg-Marquardt solve in (ln H, s) selects the physical branch
  !! (a grounded run exists exactly when the lift-off uplift is zero).
  !! Anchor above the seabed: the fully suspended span is exact when it clears the
  !! bed; otherwise the line descends to a tangent touchdown, runs along the bed and
  !! lifts off, closed by (ln H, descent length, grounded length) against the two
  !! endpoint equations and the touchdown height. A line hung in mid-water leaves the
  !! anchor uplift free in sign and grounds nothing. A vertical span (zero horizontal
  !! offset) is solved in closed form. No external optimiser is used.
  !!
  !! The closed forms are those of the classical extensible elastic catenary.

    !! Build the elastic-catenary positions-only seed. anchor/fairlead are the fixed
    !! endpoints; lengths/ea/weight are per element (n_elem). positions is the flat
    !! (3 n_nodes) seed [x1,y1,z1, x2,...] with node 1 at the anchor and node n at the
    !! fairlead, in the vertical plane through both. The seed is the exact extensible
    !! catenary on a frictionless planar seabed:
    !!   * anchor on the bed: a grounded run of length grounded_length lifting off
    !!     tangent to the bed, or (grounded_length = 0) a fully suspended span whose
    !!     anchor tangent is at or above the bed;
    !!   * anchor above the bed: the suspended span when it clears the bed, otherwise a
    !!     descent to a tangent touchdown, a grounded run and the ascent;
    !!   * taut spans (length at or below the chord) are the stretched suspended
    !!     solution; a vertical span is the stretched hanging line.
    !! horizontal_tension is H of the fairlead-side span. On a planar bed a line with no
    !! buoyant section is a convex curve between the chord and the bed, so it is no longer
    !! than the path down from the anchor to the bed, along the bed to below the fairlead
    !! and up to it (hspan + rise + twice the anchor height above a flat bed); a longer
    !! line cannot lie in the vertical plane and returns CD_CAT_NOSEED, and so does a
    !! vertical span longer than its rise. Callers fall back to their own seed then.
    !!
    !! suspended (default .FALSE.): no seabed supports the line (a line hung between two
    !!   points in mid-water). The anchor uplift is free in sign; the seed may dip below
    !!   the anchor and may end below it. seabed_z/seabed_slope are then ignored.
    !! seabed_z (optional): seabed height below the anchor [m, global z]. Default: the
    !!   anchor height (anchor resting on the bed). A value above the anchor is clamped
    !!   to the anchor (an anchor embedded in the bed is seeded as resting on it).
    !! seabed_slope (optional): seabed gradient dz/dx along the horizontal direction from
    !!   anchor to fairlead [-]. Default 0 (flat). The bed is the plane
    !!   z = seabed_z + seabed_slope*x through the vertical plane of the line.
    !! Without a seabed the fairlead may lie anywhere; with one it must lie above the bed
    !! (for the default bed, above the anchor).
