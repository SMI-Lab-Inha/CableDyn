MODULE CableDyn_OpenFAST_Aggregate
  !! Thin OpenFAST-facing facade that composes ONE deck's EI=0 mooring lines AND its
  !! finite-EI Hermite power cables behind the SAME FMF moving-point boundary the
  !! OpenFAST shell (CableDyn_OF) drives. It owns {0-or-1 CD_FMF (the EI=0 mooring
  !! system) + N CD_HFMF (one per finite-EI cable)} and exposes the CD_FMF-shaped
  !! lifecycle -- Init / NMovingPoints / GetMovingPointMesh / UpdateStates_Moving /
  !! Step_Moving / CalcOutput / End -- with the CD_FMF_* argument signatures EXACTLY, so
  !! the shell can drive the aggregate as a drop-in replacement for a bare CD_FMF.
  !!
  !! MOVING-POINT COLUMN MAP (positional): the aggregate's host-prescribed moving points
  !! run [ EI=0 system moving points | one fairlead per cable ]. Aggregate moving point
  !!   i in 1 .. ncp_sys            -> EI=0 system moving point i, and
  !!   i in ncp_sys+1 .. ncp_sys+ncable -> cable (i - ncp_sys)'s single coupled fairlead,
  !!   next nhost_rod columns               -> the k-th Coupled/Vessel ROD's End A (a 6-DOF host
  !!                                          node: orientation and angular rates in, force and
  !!                                          moment about End A out),
  !!   last nhost_body columns              -> the k-th Coupled/Vessel BODY's reference point
  !!                                          (6-DOF host node, force and moment about it),
  !! with ncp_total = ncp_sys + ncable + nhost_rod + nhost_body. All facade arrays are shaped
  !! (3, ncp_total).
  !!
  !! LOADS-OUT CONTRACT: a cable's loads-out is its constraint reaction at the current
  !! coupled kinematics against the frozen interior (the FMF "loads after the step" /
  !! direct-feedthrough contract). CD_AGG_CalcOutput computes the EI=0 system loads; each
  !! cable's fairlead reaction is read on demand in CD_AGG_GetMovingPointMesh via
  !! CD_HFMF_CalcOutput at the cable's committed state. CD_AGG_UpdateStates_Moving transfers
  !! host kinematics WITHOUT advancing for BOTH the EI=0 system columns and each cable's
  !! coupled node (via CD_HFMF_SetCoupledKinematics), so a CalcOutput taken after a fairlead
  !! move -- but before the next Step -- reflects that move (the instantaneous feedthrough
  !! load), not the last committed step.
  !!
  !! FIXED-DT CONTRACT: the aggregate and its cables are fixed-step by design (the MoorDyn-F
  !! pattern) -- the coupling dt freezes at Init and CD_AGG_Step_Moving fails closed on a step
  !! dt that differs from it (a mismatched size would silently desync the cables, whose
  !! generalised-alpha step carries the Init dt, from the mooring columns).
