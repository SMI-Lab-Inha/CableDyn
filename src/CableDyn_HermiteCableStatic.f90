MODULE CableDyn_HermiteCableStatic
  !! Finite-EI static equilibrium of a single line built from cubic-Hermite
  !! bending-cable elements (CableDyn_HermiteCable). The line is a chain of
  !! 2-node elements sharing interior nodes; each node carries [r(3), m(3)] with
  !! m = dr/ds, so the global DOF count is 6*n_nodes.
  !!
  !! Equilibrium R(q) = f_int(q) - f_ext(q) = 0 is solved by a damped Newton
  !! iteration with EI load continuation. External loads are:
  !!   * distributed submerged self-weight w (N/m, signed: > 0 net-heavy pulls
  !!     -z, < 0 net-buoyant pushes +z), applied as the CONSISTENT cubic-Hermite
  !!     generalized load on the z translation AND tangent DOFs (w l0/2 on each
  !!     end r_z, +/- w l0^2/12 on the end m_z). A lumped translation-only load
  !!     drops the tangent terms and can leave a both-ends-position-fixed span
  !!     spuriously straight;
  !!   * a penalty seabed reaction on each node: the C1-blended nodal law along the local
  !!     floor normal (x, y and z) at the normal penetration (CD_Seabed_Normal_Contact),
  !!     or the scalar k_n times the node's tributary length;
  !!   * optionally, above a free surface, the displaced-water buoyancy that the
  !!     submerged weight w assumes, restored on the dry part of each element;
  !!   * optionally, the steady-current drag, seabed friction and rotational end
  !!     connections.
  !! The tangent uses the closed-form element Kt plus the derivatives of these loads
  !! (the waterline-crossing derivative of the dry-part load among them); the self-weight
  !! generalized load is configuration-independent so it adds nothing to K.
  !!
  !! This is the finite-EI power-cable / lazy-wave static path. Unlike the Cosserat
  !! finite-EI solve it has no rotation DOFs, so it neither leaves the |theta| < pi
  !! chart nor suffers the rotational-vs-axial conditioning split; the bending
  !! stiffness enters as a well-scaled block of the position/tangent tangent.

  ! through CD_HermiteCable_Drag_Element with the element fluid velocity taken as the mean
  ! of the current at its two nodes -- the held-field drag of the dynamic path. The current
  ! is uniform (velocity) or a depth profile (profile_z, profile_velocity) sampled at the
  ! iterate's node elevations. frame_cs = (cos, sin) rotates the global current into the
  ! solve frame (global x = c xl - s yl, y = s xl + c yl). The section properties are given
  ! per reference-arc interval (arc_end, the cumulative rest length at each interval end,

  ! Static seabed friction (CD_Seabed_Friction_Spring at each node in contact): a

  ! Trust-region-style full-Newton switch. The update takes the FULL Newton step
  ! (instead of the caller's damping factor) when the PROPOSED STEP is small (below
  ! DQ_TRUST element lengths / tangent units) and the scaled residual is not far-field
  ! (below R_TRUST). Rationale, on a net-buoyant (lazy-wave) buoyancy continuation:
  !   * The step size, not the residual, is the reliable basin indicator on a stiff
  !     net-buoyant line. A warm stage can sit at a small scaled residual while Newton
  !     proposes a large step (the tangent is soft along the arch mode and the linear
  !     prediction overshoots the nonlinear stiffening); taking that step raises the
  !     residual by orders of magnitude. Conversely a secant-predicted stage start can show
  !     an O(1) scaled residual -- a tiny O(increment^2) strain error amplified by EA into
  !     force units -- while Newton proposes a small step that is essentially exact: under
  !     fixed damping the iteration then re-proposes the same small step several times,
  !     contracting the residual by only (1 - damping) per iteration.
  !   * Small proposed steps are trustworthy (the linearization is local and any contact
  !     flip they cross is self-correcting on the next iteration); large proposed steps
  !     are not, whatever the residual says.
  ! The switch keys on the current iteration's own pre-update values, so it re-damps by
  ! itself whenever the proposed step grows back above the trust radius. Effect: warm
  ! continuation stages converge in a few full Newton iterations instead of many damped
  ! ones, reaching the same converged states.

    !!                                  evaluation).
    !! torsion (optional, inout)       : condensed isotropic torsion of the line (uniform torque,

    !!                                  pi/4 halved on a failed stage. Each Newton step adds
    !!                                  E_t = (Phi - Theta)**2/(2 C) and solves the bordered
    !!                                  system [B g; g^T -C] by Sherman-Morrison on the band
    !!                                  factor (CD_HermiteTorsion_Bordered_Solve); Theta is

    !!                                  accepted iterate changes it by at most pi/2 (longer
    !!                                  steps are cut). Each converged stage is tested for
    !!                                  stability (the inertia of the tangent on the free
    !!                                  DOFs); an unstable one (above a buckling onset) is
    !!                                  left by negative-curvature descent along the lowest
    !!                                  mode and energy minimisation, unless torsion%descend
    !!                                  is false. On a converged return torsion holds the
    !!                                  accepted Theta (has_theta), the torque and the
    !!                                  stability report; any other return leaves its Theta
    !!                                  state unchanged. A re-solve with has_theta needs the
    !!                                  untwisted equilibrium within pi/2 of the stored Theta
    !!                                  (otherwise its turn count is ambiguous and the solve

    !!
    !! The seed is expected to be the exact extensible catenary of the same line (all
    !! loads at full value: submerged weight including buoyancy sections, seabed support
    !! and end positions), which is the EI -> 0 limit of the finite-EI equilibrium. The
    !! equilibrium is traced along the one-parameter family EI(lambda) = lambda*EI,
    !! lambda = ei_start -> 1, with end-connection stiffness scaled alike. For a
    !! tensioned line this family is smooth, so every stage starts inside the Newton
    !! basin of the branch that is continuously connected to the catenary; loads are not
    !! ramped, which avoids the non-unique intermediate states of a buoyancy ramp.
    !!
    !! Steps are geometric in lambda. Each stage is an energy trust-region solve (the
    !! pseudo-transient Newton retry after it) with an allowance of PTC_ITER_FACTOR*max_iter
    !! iterations; a stage that does not converge is retried from the last accepted state
    !! with half the logarithmic step. When the step falls below 1/64 decade a single
    !! full-stiffness descent from the last converged state is tried (a limit point where
    !! the equilibrium snaps to another stable configuration); the continuation then stops
    !! with NOCONVERGE, as it does once iteration_budget Newton iterations are spent.
    !! Intermediate stages use a looser tolerance (MAX(tol, 1e-6)); the final stage uses tol.
    !! The budget makes the failure path bounded: a caller's fallback route receives control
    !! after at most that many Newton iterations.
    !!
    !! Arguments mirror CD_HermiteCable_Static_Solve. ei_start in (0, 1] is the first
    !! stiffness fraction (1 solves the full problem directly from the seed).

    !! work -- buoyancy continuation, contact settlement, branch selection among the kinked
    !! local equilibria that coexist with the smooth arch -- happens ONCE on the coarsest
    !! mesh, where every Newton iteration is cheap and the smooth branch is easy to hold;

    !! fold into a kinked equilibrium; the sequenced ladder reaches the smooth branch
    !! deterministically.

    !! always hold exactly on the caller's mesh. Their enforced values are the CALLER's
    !! seed values at every level (prolongated values are overwritten before polishing).
    !! Other arguments and outputs mirror CD_HermiteCable_Static_Solve; q_out / curv_out /
    !! res_out are the finest-level results. Generalized nodal loads (f_nodal) are not

    !! equivalent scalar tributary law (derived from contact_kbot and the grounded-end
    !! diameter) for branch selection; the final polish switches to
    !! the exact nodal law. Structured bathymetry retains nodal contact at every level.
    !! reseed_coarse_tangents optionally rebuilds unit chord tangents after the first
    !! decimation. It is intended for deck-generated centreline seeds; arbitrary caller
    !! derivative data are preserved by the default false setting.

    !! Physical-branch audit of a converged finite-EI static line. A residual-converged
    !! state is accepted as the physical equilibrium only if it passes every criterion:
    !!
    !!  1. No fold or loop. With the optional per-element diameter(ne) the test is
    !!     geometric self-contact: the line may not come closer to a non-neighbouring part
    !!     of itself than the sum of the two radii (hermite_self_contact) -- every loop of a
    !!     planar line crosses itself, and a fold lying on itself touches. The tangent
    !!     reversal below is then only reported. Without diameters the reversal decides.
    !!     Reversal: without horizontal external loads the horizontal component of
    !!     the internal force is one constant H along the line. For EI = 0 (H >= 0) the
    !!     tangent is parallel to the force, so the centreline advances monotonically
    !!     along the horizontal chord heading. Bending (shear, or a small compression H < 0
    !!     that the bending stiffness carries) can lean the tangent slightly past the
    !!     vertical, but a fold or loop turns it back against the heading: every closed
    !!     loop and every hairpin contains a tangent opposite to its travel. The unit
    !!     tangent is sampled at eight stations per element; the state fails when its
    !!     component against the horizontal chord heading exceeds sin(30 deg) anywhere
    !!     outside the optional end_zone(2) arc lengths [m] next to node 1 and node nn
    !!     (the boundary layers of rotationally restrained ends). The length travelled
    !!     against the heading is reported in audit%backtrack. The check is skipped for a
    !!     chord with no horizontal extent (any vertical plane contains it).
    !!  2. Compression (evaluated always, rejected only with reject_compression). The
    !!     element-mean axial force (three-point Gauss mean of the signed axial resultant,
    !!     the quantity that enters equilibrium; pointwise traces of a stiff-EA Hermite
    !!     element oscillate about it) is compared with -max(CD_HC_COMPRESSION_REL_TOL *
    !!     peak mean tension, compression_allowance, round-off). A bending-stiff line in a
    !!     STABLE equilibrium can carry some compression; whether a compressed state is a
    !!     buckled or strut branch is decided by the stability of the equilibrium, which
    !!     callers test separately, so by default the compression is only reported
    !!     (audit%compressed).
    !!  3. No element-localized fold: max(l0 * peak curvature) <= CD_HC_KINK_LIMIT.
    !!
    !! Node 1 is the anchor end and node nn the fairlead end; q is ordered like the solve.
    !! audit%axial_min/axial_max report the pointwise extremes; audit%mean_axial_min and
    !! audit%mean_axial_max the element means used by criterion 2.
    !! audit%smoothed_axial_min is the minimum over e of the length-weighted mean of the
    !! element means of e-1, e, e+1 (clipped at the line ends); audit%smoothed_compressed
    !! compares it with the same compression_limit. An isolated compressed element between
    !! tensile neighbours (a mesh-local kink, e.g. next to a nodal seabed-contact reaction)
    !! is excluded by it; a run of three or more compressed elements never is.
    !! audit%nodal_axial_min is the minimum over interior nodes of the length-weighted
    !! average of the two adjacent element means: the node Tension output channel.

    !! relative in the slack regimes, asserted fail-closed; the tolerance admits the
    !! deliberate one-sample touchdown fillet, see seed_sample_two_segment): a seed
    !! substantially shorter than the rest length carries an EA-amplified compressive
    !! state that buckles the continuation into folded local equilibria (the dominant
    !! failure mode when a bed-clamped bowed chord is up to ~30% short).
    !!
    !! Construction, in the vertical plane through the endpoints (planar y = plane; the
    !! seed is 3D-safe for out-of-plane endpoints via the horizontal unit vector):
    !!   * taut (SUM(l0) <= chord): nodes along the chord at rest-length stations
    !!     (uniform positive strain -- tension, not buckling), with tangents at the
    !!     consistent stretch gauge |m| = chord/SUM(l0) (m = dr/ds);
    !!   * ONE end on the bed, slack (either order -- the repository's finite-EI line
    !!     convention runs anchor -> fairlead, so a grounded end A is built as the
    !!     mirrored reversed line and mapped back, node i <- reversed node nn+1-i with
    !!     the tangent negated): the exact two-segment touchdown split. x_td from
    !!     sqrt(x_td^2 + h_a^2) + (x_ah - x_td) = L gives a straight span + straight
    !!     grounded run, isometric by construction. Beyond the L-shape length
    !!     (L >= h_a + x_ah, where x_td <= 0) NO planar equilibrium free of bed
    !!     wadding exists at all -- the surplus length must fold somewhere on a
    !!     frictionless bed -- so the seed switches to a quarter-ellipse landing leg
    !!     (vertical launch, tangentially horizontal touchdown) with the excess in a
    !!     sin^2-windowed bulge, and the SOLVED equilibrium is legitimately a
    !!     wadded-surplus shape. (An analytic grounded catenary is not used as the
    !!     primary here: CD_Catenary_Seed's endpoint closure can return hooked
    !!     non-classical shapes beyond its tested slackness.);
    !!   * BOTH ends on the bed, slack: a fully grounded laid-cable S -- the surplus
    !!     meanders in the bed plane (sine bow along the horizontal perpendicular, same
    !!     bisection). Planar-pinned callers note: no smooth in-plane shape exists for
    !!     this geometry at all (the L-shape law with h = 0), so a planar solve lands
    !!     in the wadded-surplus class from any seed;
    !!   * both ends above the bed: a suspended sine bow perpendicular to the chord on
    !!     the sagging side, depth by the same bisection; when that bow would cross the
    !!     seabed, an isometric double-touchdown construction instead (two touchdown
    !!     points moved apart, then vertical legs with the surplus in a smooth bow over
    !!     the middle run; seed_sample_double_touchdown).
