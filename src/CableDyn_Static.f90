MODULE CableDyn_Static
  !! Static Newton-Raphson + Armijo solver for the positions-only EI=0 cable path.
  !! Given an initial guess, a constant external load f_ext
  !! (e.g. gravity from CableDyn_Loads), the prescribed (Dirichlet) DOFs, and an
  !! OPTIONAL penalty seabed,
  !! drive the residual R = f_int(q) - f_ext - f_seabed(q) to zero on the free DOFs by
  !! Newton iteration with an Armijo backtracking line search on the 1/2||R||^2 merit.
  !! The free-DOF tangent block is assembled directly in reduced LAPACK band storage
  !! (element, seabed and drag contributions alike) and solved with DGBSV, so every
  !! Newton iteration costs O(n_dof * bandwidth) in time and memory.
  !!
  !! When the OPTIONAL seabed arguments are present, the configuration-dependent
  !! penalty contact force + its residual-Jacobian term are recomputed inside every
  !! residual/tangent evaluation (grounded catenary / mooring equilibrium); when
  !! absent it is the constant-f_ext solve, bit-for-bit unchanged. An OPTIONAL
  !! steady current adds configuration-dependent Morison drag (CableCurrentLoad), and with
  !! it the seabed friction that holds the line against the current (friction springs from
  !! the still-water laid shape). Damping and wave loads belong to the dynamic path.
  !!
  !! Conventions match the other modules: q is the flat (3 n_nodes) positions-only
  !! state [x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2, ...]; node nd owns DOFs 3*nd-2:3*nd; fixed_dofs are
  !! 1-based global DOF indices held at their q0 value.

    !! regularized (default .FALSE.): Levenberg-Marquardt globalization. The Newton system
    !! is shifted to (K_t + mu*kappa*I) dq = -R, kappa = max|T|/min(l0) the geometric
    !! stiffness scale of the line; mu shrinks by 4 after a full accepted step (towards the
    !! plain Newton step, so local convergence is unchanged), doubles after a backtracked
    !! one, and grows by 16 when the line search finds no descent (the step is retried
    !! rather than declared a stall). A penalty seabed makes the residual only piecewise
    !! smooth: every node that crosses the seabed plane kinks it, the plain Newton step
    !! overshoots each kink and Armijo cuts it to a few percent, so a touchdown that must
    !! migrate over many elements (a fine mesh of a stiff line) exhausts the plain solve.

    !! exact tension-only law, r = 1 the compression-capable one, and a small r > 0 keeps a
    !! slack element's tangent non-singular while its compressive force stays negligible.
    !! Slack elements can leave directions without stiffness (a grounded node between two
    !! slack elements slides freely on a frictionless seabed), so in this mode the

    !! profile that lifts off into a suspended catenary; the grounded catenary lowered by
    !! the static penalty penetration; for a grounded line longer than span plus rise, the
    !! H -> 0 limit (a straight hanging leg with the excess on the seabed, folded back where
    !! the seabed keeps falling); the other catenary variant; and a two-leg polyline of the
    !! right length that never compresses the line. Seed nodes deeper below the seabed than
    !! their static penetration are lifted onto it.

    !!   A. Newton (plain, then Levenberg-Marquardt) with the compression-capable law, first at

    !!   B. (tension-only lines, when A fails or lands on a compressed strut/arch branch)
    !!      Levenberg-Marquardt with the slack-capable law of CD_Static_Cable_Solve: a
    !!      compressed-branch stiffness r EA with r EA of order 1e-3, then 1e-7, of the largest
    !!      nodal load (too weak to hold an arch), then the exact tension-only law (r = 0).
    !!      Accepted when the exact tension-only residual meets the solver tolerance (or, from
